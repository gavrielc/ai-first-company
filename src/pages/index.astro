      <h1>AI-First Company Memos</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        In April 2025, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke published an internal memo declaring AI usage
        a baseline expectation for every employee. Within weeks, CEOs across industries posted
        their own versions. The AI-first memo became a genre. Here they all are.

        The memo required teams to demonstrate why AI couldn't do a job before requesting
        headcount. AI proficiency would be built into performance reviews. Prototyping should
        be "dominated by AI exploration." The line everyone quoted: "Stagnation is slow-motion failure."

        Same month, completely different energy. Where Lutke said "prove AI can't do it
        before you hire," Levie flipped it: prove you <em>can</em> use AI effectively,
        and you'll <em>get more</em> headcount. Friday all-hands became "show and tell"

        <summary>What the memos tell us when you read them together</summary>

        <div class="details-content">
          <h3>Three philosophies, one format</h3>
          <p>
            Reading these memos side by side, a pattern emerges. They all use the same
            format (CEO writes to all employees about AI transformation) but contain three
            fundamentally different philosophies about what "AI-first" means.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>AI as gate.</strong> Shopify, Duolingo, and Fiverr share a version of this:
            before you get resources (headcount, budget, tools), demonstrate that AI can't do
            the work. The human must justify their role relative to AI. This is the most provocative
            framing, and it generates the most press.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>AI as ladder.</strong> Box takes this approach. AI doesn't replace
            people, it makes them more productive, and the productivity gains get reinvested.
            Teams that adopt AI get <em>more</em> resources, not fewer. Levie specifically
            contrasted his approach with Duolingo's "prove AI can't do it" framing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>AI as fait accompli.</strong> Klarna didn't write a forward-looking
            memo. It reported what had already happened. This framing is the riskiest. When
            Klarna's numbers turned out to tell a simpler story than reality allowed, the reversal
            was public and awkward.
          </p>

          <h3>The memo is the strategy</h3>
          <p>
            The CEO AI memo isn't a communication <em>about</em> strategy. It <em>is</em> strategy.
            Writing it and publishing it under your own name does several things at once that no
            Slack message or quiet policy change could.
          </p>
          <p>
            It creates accountability. Every manager now has cover to enforce it and no room to
            ignore it. It sets the narrative externally. Investors, analysts, and potential hires
            all read these memos. Lutke didn't just tell Shopify employees to use AI. He told the
            market that Shopify is an AI company. And it creates peer pressure. Not having a memo
            started to look like not having a strategy.
          </p>

          <h3>Nobody defines it</h3>
          <p>
            The most revealing thing about these memos is what's absent: a definition. None of
            them define what "AI-first" actually means. Lutke says it's a "baseline expectation"
            but doesn't specify what that looks like for a designer vs. a supply chain manager.
            Von Ahn says Duolingo is "AI-first" but has to walk it back months later because
            people filled in their own definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's not a flaw. The memo works <em>because</em> it's directional rather than
            definitional. It says "this is where we're going" without getting bogged down in
            what it looks like when you arrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The investors are further along on definitions than the operators. Bessemer draws
            a line between companies advancing AI as a science vs. using it as a distribution
            machine. Intel Capital uses a four-tier spectrum from AI-Enhanced to AI-Native. Sequoia
            looks at revenue per employee. Hit $1M+ and you're probably the real thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the CEOs don't need taxonomies. They need momentum. And the memo, public,
            permanent, attached to their name, creates it.
          </p>

          <h3>The Klarna lesson</h3>
          <p>
            Every CEO writing one of these memos should read Klarna's story. Siemiatkowski went
            further than anyone: a hiring freeze, a 40% headcount reduction, public celebrations
            of AI replacing hundreds of agents. Then he reversed course, admitted quality had
            suffered, and started hiring humans again.
          </p>
          <p>
            He's been more open about this than most executives would be. He's publicly wrestled
            with the implications, writing that AI could make his own role unnecessary, which he
            finds "gloomy." But the arc (from loud AI-first announcements to quietly hiring humans
            again) exposes the gap between the CEO AI memo as a communications device and what's
            actually happening inside the company.
